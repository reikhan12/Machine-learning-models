# Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones â€“ Final Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a complete machine learning project on **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones**, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model building, and interpretation.

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify human activities (e.g., walking, sitting, standing) based on data collected from smartphone accelerometers and gyroscopes. The project follows a typical data science pipeline including:

- Data import and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model comparison and interpretation
- Final report and presentation
